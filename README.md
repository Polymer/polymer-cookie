# polymer-cookie

The polymer-cookie element can be used to set and read cookies.

You should have one polymer-cookie element per cookie you want to use, defined by its name property. You can then read the value of the cookie, or save the cookie by setting the value attribute or explicitely calling the save method.

## Example

``` html
<polymer-cookie name="mycookie"></polymer-cookie>
```
